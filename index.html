  		<h1>Latina Trailblazer: Jessica Ramos Joins NYC Mayoral Contest</h1>
  		<h2>By: Cindy Marchionda</h2>
		<h3>October 13, 2024</h3>

		<p>
			Jessica Ramos, a progressive state senator from Queens, announced she would be running for mayor on September 13, 2024, as Mayor Eric Adams continues to face a series of federal investigations.  She is the fourth democrat to challenge Adams and is the only Latina woman entering the race thus far.  The primary isn’t until June 2025, so a lot could happen between now and then.

		</p>

		<!--I wish I had a better picture of Jessica.  We were challenged in the jpg department-->

			<h2>Ramos is a mother and a renter and an everyday New Yorker. </h2>

			<!--I loved this quote!-->
			<p>
				In her campaign kickoff video, Ramos says: “I’m a mother, I’m a renter, I’m a straphanger.  In our city, there is a place for everyone.”

				As a State Senator, Jessica Ramos in the past six years has claims she has raised the minimum wage, expanded child care, fought for union workers, supported small business, won historic tenent protections, and defended our first responders.

			<h2>Ramos wants to bring trust back to City Hall.</h2>
			<p>
				As reported by Spectrum NY1 News, “We New Yorkers are yearning for a new day in our city,” Ramos said. “We work very hard and want to see the fruits of our labor. I want to be the bridge between all of the five boroughs and forge a future that is worthy of all of the sacrifices and hard work that we do.”

				Ramos proudly announced on Twitter that Teamster Unions Local 804 and 808 have endorsed her run for mayor. @jessicaramosqns

		<h2>A bolder push toward making taxpayer money work for everyday New Yorkers.</h2>
		<p>
			Ramos told Christopher Robbins of Hell Gate, "The reason I'm running is precisely because I think there's a lot of course correction that needs to be done, and we also need to make a bolder push toward making our taxpayer dollars work for us in a way that they're just not right now."
		</p>

		<section class="content-block">
			<h2>Ramos is an outspoken critic of Adams and a fighter.</h2>
			<p>
				Pundits say Ramos lacks the money and citywide experience from some of her other contenders.  Her other challengers are Comptroller Brad Lander, State Senator Zellnor Myrie, Former New York City comptroller Scott M. Stringer, Republican Curtis Silwa and possibly former New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo, which is still just a pipedream at this point.
